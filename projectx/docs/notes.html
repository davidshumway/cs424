<h5>Project X - Power to the People: Interesting notes on the data</h5>

<h5>Non-Renewable energy</h5>

<p>There are three main regions of the world where nuclear power plants are clustered: the United States, Europe, and East Asia.</p>

<p>There is only one coal power source above 2,000 MW in all of Latin America, which is located in Mexico, and no coal power sources above 3,000 MW in Latin America.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, outside of one 5,000 MW coal power source located in Poland, the other seven coal power sources above 5,000 MW in the world are located in either China, Taiwan, South Korea, or Indonesia.</p>

<p>The largest oil power sources in the world (those above 3,000 MW) are located in either Saudi Arabia (4) or Japan (5).</p>

<p>The largest gas power sources in the world (those above 5,000 MW) are located in either Kuwait (2), Russia (2), or Japan (1).</p>

<p>The largest nuclear power sources in the world (those above 5,000 MW) are located in either France (3), Ukraine (1), South Korea (2), or Japan (1).</p>

<p>The foremost countries utilizing waste as a power source include the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Brazil, and Australia.</p>

<p>The largest nuclear power sources in the world (those above 5,000 MW) are located in either France (3), Ukraine (1), South Korea (2), or Japan (1).</p>

<h5>Renewable energy</h5>

<p>
  The two largest hydro power sources in the world are located in China.
</p>
<p>
  The largest wind farm in the world is the Gansu Wind Farm located in China.
</p>
<p>
  The use of biomass as an energy source is mainly limited to the Americas and western Europe, although parts of southeast Africa, India, southeast Asia, and eastern Australia also utilize it as an energy source.
</p>

<p>Across the world, solar and wind energy appear to share a similar spatial distribution. Japan has many more solar power sources than wind power sources, while conversely Brazil has a lot more wind power sources than solar power sources.</p>

<p>
  There are not many power sources represented in the dataset with "storage" shown as the primary fuel source, and all of the storage power sources in the dataset are located in the United States.
</p>

<p>
  There are not many power sources represented in the dataset with "cogeneration" shown as the primary fuel source. All of the cogeneration power sources in the dataset are located in either the United States or United Kingdom.
</p>

<p>
  There are not many wave and tidal power sources represented in the dataset. The few wave and tidal power sources are located in Canada, United Kingdom, France, Europe, and South Korea.
