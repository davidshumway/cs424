<p>Overview:<br>
This application provides visualizations of power production data from all 50 US states and the District of Columbia, as well as from the US as a whole, for the time period 1990-2019. Visualizations include stacked bar chart, line chart, tabular data, and heatmap. Nine types of energy production are represented: Coal, Geothermal, Hydro, Natural Gas, Nuclear, Petroleum, Solar, Wind, and Wood. A side-by-side split-screen view allows users to compare between different different regions and energy mixes.
